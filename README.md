Create a private Repository on yours GitHub account and give me rights to view and edit it.

Prerequisites:

- No database
- Total money in ATM: 1000, but we might change it in the future.
- I couldn't withdraw more than 200.
- I couldn't withdraw in decimals.
- When I try to withdraw more then I can, I'd like to see the error message like so: "You couldn't withdraw more than {amount} at once."
- When I try to withdraw money and there is no money left in the ATM, I'd like to see the error message like so: "No cash available at this moment."
